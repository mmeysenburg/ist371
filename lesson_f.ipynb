        "\r\n",
        "In this episode, we will learn how to use `skimage` functions to apply *edge detection* to an image. In edge detection, we find the boundaries or edges of objects in an image, by determining where the brightness of the image changes dramatically. Edge detection can be used to extract the structure of objects in an image. If we are interested in the number, size, shape, or relative location of objects in an image, edge detection allows us to focus on the parts of the image most helpful, while ignoring parts of the image that will not help us.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "For example, once we have found the edges of the objects in the image (or once we have converted the image to binary using thresholding), we can use that information to find the *connected components* of an image, which we will learn about in the following episode. With these, we can do things like count the number of objects in the image, measure the size of the objects, classify the shapes of the objects, and so on.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As was the case for blurring and thresholding, there are several different methods in `skimage` that can be used for edge detection, so we will examine only one in detail."

        "The obvious edge in the image is the vertical line between the black paper and the white paper. To our eyes, there is a quite sudden change between the black pixels and the white pixels. But, at a pixel-by-pixel level, is the transition really that sudden?\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "If we zoom in on the edge more closely, as in this image, we can see that the edge between the black and white areas of the image is not a clear-cut line.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Our edge detection method in this workshop is *Canny edge detection*, created by John Canny in 1986. This method uses a series of steps, some incorporating other types of edge detection. The `skimage` `skimage.feature.canny()` function performs the following steps:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "1. A Gaussian blur (that is characterized by the `sigma` parameter, see the previous lesson) is applied to remove noise from the image. (So if we are doing edge detection via this function, we should not perform our own blurring step.)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2. *Sobel edge detection* is performed on both the $x$ and $y$ dimensions, to find the intensity gradients of the edges in the image. Sobel edge detection computes the derivative of a curve fitting the gradient between light and dark areas in an image, and then finds the peak of the derivative, which is interpreted as the location of an edge pixel.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. Pixels that would be highlighted, but seem too far from any edge, are removed. This is called *non-maximum suppression*, and the result is edge lines that are thinner than those produced by other methods.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. A double threshold is applied to determine potential edges. Here extraneous pixels caused by noise or milder color variation than desired are eliminated. If a pixel's gradient value -- based on the Sobel differential -- is above the high threshold value, it is considered a strong candidate for an edge. If the gradient is below the low threshold value, it is turned off. If the gradient is in between, the pixel is considered a weak candidate for an edge pixel.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. Final detection of edges is performed using *hysteresis*. Here, weak candidate pixels are examined, and if they are connected to strong candidate pixels, they are considered to be edge pixels; the remaining, non-connected weak candidates are turned off.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "For a user of the `skimage.feature.canny()` edge detection function, there are three important parameters to pass in: `sigma` for the Gaussian filter in step one and the low and high threshold values used in step four of the process. These values generally are determined empirically, based on the contents of the image(s) to be processed.\r\n",

        "We are interested in finding the edges of the shapes in the image, and so the colors are not important. Our strategy will be to read the image as grayscale, and then apply Canny edge detection. Note that when reading the image with `skimage.io.imread(..., as_gray=True)` the image is converted to a `float64` grayscale with the original dtype range being mapped to values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.\r\n"
