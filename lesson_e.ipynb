        "\r\n",
        "In this lesson, we will learn how to use `skimage` functions to blur images. When we blur an image, we make the color transition from one side of an edge in the image to another smooth rather than sudden. The effect is to average out rapid changes in pixel intensity. The blur, or smoothing, of an image removes \"outlier\" pixels that may be noise in the image. Blurring is an example of applying a *low-pass filter* to an image. In computer vision, the term \"low-pass filter\" applies to removing noise from an image while leaving the majority of the image intact. A blur is a very common operation we need to perform before other tasks such as edge detection. There are several different blurring functions in the `skimage.filters` module, so we will focus on just one here, the Gaussian blur."

So that the filter pixel is always in the center of the kernel, the width and height of the kernel must be odd. In the example shown above, the kernel is square, with a dimension of seven pixels.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To apply this filter to the current pixel, a weighted average of the the color values of the pixels in the kernel is calculated. In a Gaussian blur, the pixels nearest the center of the kernel are given more weight than those far away from the center. This averaging is done on a channel-by-channel basis, and the average channel values become the new value for the filtered pixel. Larger kernels have more values factored into the average, and this implies that a larger kernel will blur the image more than a smaller kernel.\r\n",

        "Imagine that plot overlaid over the kernel for the Gaussian blur filter. The height of the plot corresponds to the weight given to the underlying pixel in the kernel. I.e., the pixels close to the center become more important to the filtered pixel color than the pixels close to the edge of the kernel. The shape of the Gaussian function is controlled via its standard deviation, or sigma. A large sigma value results in a flatter shape, while a smaller sigma value results in a more pronounced peak. The mathematics involved in the Gaussian blur filter are not quite that simple, but this explanation gives you the basic idea.\r\n",

The third parameter, `truncate`, gives the radius of the kernel in terms of sigmas. A Gaussian is defined from -infinity to +infinity. A discrete Gaussian can only approximate the real function. The `truncate` parameter steers at what distance to the center of the function it is not approximated any more. In the above example we set `truncate` to 3.5. With a `sigma` of 1.0 the resulting kernel size would be 7. The default value for truncate in `sklearn` is 4.0. The last parameter is to tell `skimage` how to interpret our image, that has three dimensions, as a multichannel color image.
