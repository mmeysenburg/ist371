        "\r\n",
        "In this episode, we will learn how to use skimage functions to apply thresholding to an image. Thresholding is a type of *image segmentation*, where we change the pixels of an image to make the image easier to analyze. In thresholding, we convert an image from color or grayscale into a *binary image*, i.e., one that is simply black and white. Most frequently, we use thresholding as a way to select areas of interest of an image, while ignoring the parts we are not concerned with. We have already done some simple thresholding, in the \"Manipulating pixels\" section of the Skimage Images episode. In that case, we used a simple NumPy array manipulation to separate the pixels belonging to the root system of a plant from the black background. In this episode, we will learn how to use skimage functions to perform thresholding. Then, we will use the masks returned by these functions to select the parts of an image we are interested in."

In other words, we want to leave the pixels belonging to the shapes \"on,\" while turning the rest of the pixels \"off,\" by setting their color channel values to zeros. The `skimage` library has several different methods of thresholding. We will start with the simplest version, which involves an important step of human input. Specifically, in this simple, *fixed-level thresholding*, we have to provide a threshold value, `t`.\r\n",

Pixels with color values on one side of `t` will be turned \"on,\" while pixels with color values on the other side will be turned \"off.\" In order to use this function, we have to determine a good value for `t`. How might we do that? Well, one way is to look at a grayscale histogram of the image. Here is the histogram produced by the code from the Creating Histograms episode, if we run it on the colored shapes image shown above.\r\n",

If we want to select the shapes and not the background, we want to turn off the white background pixels, while leaving the pixels for the shapes turned on. So, we should choose a value of `t` somewhere before the large peak and turn pixels above that value \"off\".\r\n",
